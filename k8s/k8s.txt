 draw the k8s architecture and explain the flow with a monilithic archtecture

 Real life scenario based ques:

 1.Scenario 1: Suppose a company built on monolithic architecture handles numerous products. Now, as we expands in todayâ€™s scaling industry, their monolithic architecture started causing problems.

How do you think we can shift from monolithic to microservices and deploy their services containers?


2.Scenario 2: Consider a multinational company with a very much distributed system, with a large number of data centers, virtual machines, and many employees working on various tasks.

How do you think can such a company manage all the tasks in a consistent way with Kubernetes?

3.Lets say in a situation where a company wants to increase its efficiency and the speed of its technical operations by maintaining minimal costs. How company cna acheive this?

4. the shift from monolithic to microservices solves the problem from the development side, but increases the problem at the deployment side.

How can we solve the problem on the deployment side?
